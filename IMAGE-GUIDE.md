## 🎨 Tips for Images

- Keep them all the **same size** (around 200x200px works great)
- Use **similar style** puppies for consistency
- Make sure the **angry knife image** is funny, not scary!
- The knife can be a cartoon/toy knife for humor

**Your website will work even without these images** - it will just show broken image icons. Add the images to see the full effect! 🐶💕
